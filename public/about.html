<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Currently, I am taking courses to improve my skills on becoming a full stack .NET Developer.
  Previously, I have been doing Windows desktop development in C#.NET. I have used
  VB/C#.NET to perform software updates to a financial systems for one project.
  I worked with SQL Server, TFS, Git, Window Forms and WPF. On another project I
  used frontend skills such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Cordova, jQuery mobile
  and other 3rd party libraries to make updates to a hybrid mobile application
  for about a year. I used VB.NET and SQL Server for ETL development to create
  new or modify existing parsers that extract data from invoices.
